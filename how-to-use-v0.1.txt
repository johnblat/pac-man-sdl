TILEMAP EDITOR
---------------

LMB: 
    1. Select a tile in the tile selection panel. 
    2. Place a tile in the tile map area
RMB: Remove a tile in the tile map area
S: Save map to the "level" file
L: Load the map from the "level" file 

- To change the texture that is loaded for the level, ensure that it is 2x18 tiles and placed in a .png file in the PacGame directory. The file must be named "tileset.png"
    - To store temporarily, just change the filename of existing tilesets that you don't want to currently use. 
    - You can test with different dimensions to see the effects
- Place the tileset image in the PacGame directory at the root. It must be in the same directory as TileMapEditor and Game.
- Try not to touch the "level" file. It is auto-generated by the TileMapEditor when saving


GAME
------

ARROW KEYS: Change direction

When the Game opens, it will immediately load the level saved in the "level" file.
Currently, Pacman will spawn at tile ( 0,0 ), which is the leftmost and topmost tile.
