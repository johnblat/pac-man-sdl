PAC BILBE
---------

    - Contains a functionality spec sheet from a player perspective
    - Contains all rules, items, level concepts, controls, etc that the players will use 
    - Also contains any known issues any of the gameplay mechanics 


CONCEPT
---------

- 2 to 4 player Pac-Man style game where the winner is whomever gets the highest score once the final pac-dot is eaten
    - once a player gets too high, spawn a score bonus item
    - player dies - pac-dots get released on the maze
    - items that add abilities that aren't score based
    - board randomizer
    - approach player from behind, damage them, maybe player has certain number of hits they can take
    - attack player with item that damages them


BALANCING GAME SESSION
------------------------

- The game should end once the maze is cleared
- There should be a way that players that have a lower score can catch up
- Problem: 
    - Say there are a total of 100 points
    - Once player 1 gets 51 points, they win
    - Instead, there should be a way so that other players can get the points back


CONTROLS
----------

- Each player gets Four directional buttons and an Action Button 

- Possible controllers
    - Keyboard Sets
        - WASD + E/Q 
        - IJKL + O/U 
        - ARROW KEYS + CTRL/0 
        - 8456 + 7/9
    - Gamepads
        - DPAD + Any Face Button

- Players can choose to use a gamepad or one of the Keyboard Sets to use 

- Keyboard sets may need to be deprecated if any of the items or gameplay mechanics require more buttons. For instance, one idea for an item would be "double pac-man." This item would create a clone of the player who gets it and they would be able to control it with the four face buttons acting as another DPAD. And control the original pac-man with the left DPAD.

            - May want to limit the drill item to one map in this case or a few maps that utilize the drill item
